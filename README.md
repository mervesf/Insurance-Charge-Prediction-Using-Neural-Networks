# Insurance-Charge-Prediction-Using-Neural-Networks
In this project, I developed a model to predict insurance charges using a dataset that includes features such as age, BMI, and smoking status. I preprocessed the data using normalization and one-hot encoding, then built and trained two neural network models to evaluate their performance on predicting insurance costs.
